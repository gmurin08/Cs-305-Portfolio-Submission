# Cs-305-Portfolio-Submission


The client, Artemis Finanacial, a financial advising firm, wants to expand their reach by implementing a web application. Artemis Finacial approached our company to handle their concerns over the security of their application. 
In terms of what was done well, the manual code reviews proved to be quite successful in finding bugs in the code. Using the dependency check tool was also useful for finding known vulnerabilities in the app's dependencies. 
I found the vulnerability assesment tool in general to be relatively intuitive to implememt, and extremely helpful in assessing the applciations security. The html report generated provides links directly to the NIST vulnerability database where extensive records can be browsed to obtain futher information. 
To ensure that the code was functional and secure, manual code reviews were performed to look for syntatical and logical errors. After refactoring the code, a dependency check report was generated to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced in to the system. 
The codebase from project two provides a good snapshot of the skills that we've acquired throughout the course and would be what i would most likely showcase to an employer to demonstrate my ability to produce secure software.
